* Accounts of a Perl Reunification Summit began to surface on [the #perl6 irc channel](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-19#i_5909381) and then later in tweets ([1](https://twitter.com/pmichaud/status/237219819139780608), [2](https://twitter.com/pmichaud/status/237219997062152192)) and blogs ([1](http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/2012-quo-vadis-perl.html), [2](http://mdk.per.ly/2012/08/20/prs2012-perl5-perl6-reunification-summit/)). Perl 5 and 6 have been doing their own thing for years. Around twenty Perl 5 and 6 folk got together to discuss "reunification". Interested parties should tune in to the #p6p5 twitter hashtag, and the #p6p5 IRC channel on irc.perl.org.
* masak noted that ["TimToady is now working actively on STD_P5.pm6"](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-19#i_5909630). (TimToady is Larry Wall, the author of all versions of Perl, including 5 and 6 (he was of course at the reunification summit). STD_P5.pm6 is a Perl 5 parser written in Perl 6.)

* ["Perl 5 folks were like "I CAN HAS?""](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-20#i_5911874) when they saw the [Perl 6 debugger](https://github.com/jnthn/rakudo-debugger/) that jnthn introduced at YAPC:EU. It's in the latest Rakudo Star release.
* tadzik noted he's working on [a fork of modules.perl6.org](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-20#i_5912006).
* Moritz posted [a brief Rakudo vs Niecza comparison](https://gist.github.com/3406172).

* mj41 posted [completeness pie charts for the Rakudo and Niecza Perl 6 compilers](https://raw.github.com/mj41/Perl-6-GD/master/export/Summary%20-%20Compilers%27%20features%20-%20GoodData.png)
* jnthn posted [a PDF of the slides of jnthn's YAPC talk on Perl 6 exceptions](http://jnthn.net/papers/2012-yapceu-exceptions.pdf). It's a great presentation, but the slide about the debugger, slide 49, just says "do live_demo() or fail;". :/

[2012-08-23](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-23):

* jnthn started a [P5Regex](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-23#i_5920838) branch.
* sirrobert added [the Masquerade module](https://github.com/sirrobert/Masquerade).
