I fondly recall the excellent summaries of Perl 6 mailing list
discussions Piers Cawley posted back in the day. He kept it going for
years. Nowadays the main Perl 6 action is the [freenode IRC channel
\#perl6](http://webchat.freenode.net/). This is the first of what I hope
will be a regular series of \#perl6 highlight posts.

[2012-08-11](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-11:):

  * [TimToady added 444th Rosettacode
    entry](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-11#i_5892442). Brief,
    elegant Perl 6 code implementing ["Parse an IP Address"
    task](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Parse_an_IP_Address#Perl_6)
    compares well with Go, Python, and Ruby code (all of which use a lib
    call to do the parsing in contrast to Larry's Perl 6 solution).

[2012-08-12](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-12):

  * [Moritz added snippets by Masak to
    perl6.org](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-12#i_5892737)
    resulting in [perl6.org/snippet](http://perl6.org/snippet).
  * [arnsholt pushed branch that will improve sized int/num handling in
    C code
    callbacks](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-12#i_5893115)
  * [jeffreykegler arrived on \#perl6 exploring creation of a P6ish
    interface for
    Marpa](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-12#i_5893420). (Marpa
    is Jeffrey's tool ["for parsing languages that are too complex for
    regular expressions to handle](http://www.jeffreykegler.com/marpa)
    (which of course overlaps Perl 6's domain).)
  * [pmichaud noted that the YAPC::EU supervisor tees have a huge 5 on
    them...](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-12#i_5893694).
    (pmichaud has since printed [Perl 6
    tees](http://pmichaud.com/sandbox/img_4213.jpg). Note Camelia and
    the beer mug. :) (And note that this followed an earlier discovery
    that ZERO Perl 6 talks had been accepted for YAPC::EU, something the
    Rakudo team has also helped fix.)

[2012-08-13](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-13):

  * [TimToady added Same Fringe Rosettacode
    entry](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-14#i_5896313). Brief,
    elegant Perl 6 code compares well with C, D, Haskell, Python. (Of
    course, J, as ever, wins the codegolfing prize.)
  * [Moritz introduced pod-gist. Pretty printing and debugging of Pod
    blocks](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-14#i_5897048)
  * [Coke noted this quarter's applications for a perlfoundation
    grant](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-14#i_5897142). (Just
    one Perl 6 application.)
  * [Coke noted that Rakudo is now passing 23K of 24K
    spectests](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-14#i_5897352)

[2012-08-15](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15):

  * [Sorear revealed plans for a
    niecza/js](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5899445).
    Perl 6 in your web browser anyone?
    [try.niecza.com](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5899723)?
  * [topo made almost everything in 99-problems run in both niecza and
    rakudo](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5900284)
  * [Moritz landed sigilless
    parameters](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5900458).
    Larry specc'd sigilless parameters and variables a while back. Turns
    out it's a speed optimization too.
  * [masak started Moritz's new Perl 6 Release Dates
    chatbot](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5900570).
  * [Moritz committed sigilless my
    variables](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5901075)
  * [Moritz landed operators for p6doc
    search](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-15#i_5901462). I
    didn't know [p6doc search](http://doc.perl6.org/search) existed.

[2012-08-16](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-16):

  * [Coke linked chart of passing tests against time by the big
    3](http://feather.perl6.nl/%7Ecoke/roast/)

[2012-08-18](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-18):

  * [tadzik: "panda now works on windows
    \\o/"](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-18#i_5907655) (panda
    is the new Perl 6 module installer; it's got to the point just days
    ago that tadzik had said he's "satisfied with panda" at least
    "feature-wise" and tadzik++ and japhb++ have since improved it
    anyway)
  * [Moritz made one of several commits to Rakudo to match parrot IO
    changes](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-18#i_5906998)
  * [Sorear revealed Sekrit Perl 5 & Perl 6 Summit held in...
    Perl](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-08-18#i_5908186). (Yep,
    there really is a town called Perl, and there really has been a
    Sekrit Summit.)
