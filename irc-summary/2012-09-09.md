<a name="Notes"></a>Notes

* This report covers a week of discussion and activity on [freenode IRC channel #perl6](http://webchat.freenode.net), the center of the Perl 6 community.
* The first commit of the week for each repo is usually included in this summary no matter how minor. Later commits to the same repo, especially ones by the same person, will typically be omitted even if major unless we really feel the need to bring it to attention. So <font color="maroon">**there's a heck of a lot more committing going on than appears in this summary**</font> and commits happening later in the week will often be a lot more important than the ones mentioned in this report. You can Watch the github repos that interest you if you need more info on commits.
* Each bullet point ends with two or more hashtags. The first indicates the bullet point's topic, eg #cpan6 if it's about a Perl 6 module, the module installer, and related topics. The last indicates what happened eg #commits if someone committed something, #dialog if a dialog ensued.
* Individual items were suggested by raiph. The overall report was written by raiph.
