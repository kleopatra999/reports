* [01:06 MikeFair](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5951965) asked for help. "I have a rule stat_or_block { <block> | <statement> }". TimToady helped.
* [02:01 jeffreykegler](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952017) asked for help.	"I have a question about semantics in grammar rules". TimToady discussed some of the key tricks used by the unusual animal [STD](https://github.com/perl6/std/blob/master/STD.pm6). (STD.pm6 and STD_P5.pm6 are both written in Perl 6. One parses Perl 6, the other Perl 5. Both optionally call out to viv, a "retargettable metacompiler for the static subset of Perl 6" written in Perl 5.)
* [02:22 MikeFair](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02) said some stuff that went over my head: "TimToady: I'm working on building up to establishing the AST as a service and using zmq's zero-copy mechanisms as a sort of in process SOA".
* [04:38 MikeFair](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952159) began a monolog with "TimToady: Still about? If I'm understanding the [emic and etic descriptions](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952103) right then emic => class and etic=> interface that class implements".
* [05:34 isBEKaml](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952215) reported a problem: "OHHAI, pugs-compat cabal build with GHC 7.4.1 shows failure. Seems to depend on haskell98 but is unable to locate it. https://gist.github.com/3595096" and followed up with an explanation.
* [06:15 sorear](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952246) said "niecza is losing -Ofun for me, so I'm probably not going to be doing too much with it; my Perl 6 involvement in the future is likely to be with the Rakudo/NQP porting efforts". Regardless of how he feels about that (relief? disappointment? excitement? trepidation?) I think this is going to be great news for Sorear, NQP, Perl 6, Rakudo, Rakudo on JVM, .NET, etc.

<a name="Notes"></a>Notes

* This report covers a week of discussion and activity on [freenode IRC channel #perl6](http://webchat.freenode.net), the center of the Perl 6 community.
* The first commit of the week for each repo is usually included in this summary no matter how minor. Later commits to the same repo, especially ones by the same person, will typically be omitted even if major unless we really feel the need to bring it to attention. So <font color="maroon">**there's a heck of a lot more committing going on than appears in this summary**</font> and commits happening later in the week will often be a lot more important than the ones mentioned in this report. You can Watch the github repos that interest you if you need more info on commits.
* Each bullet point ends with two or more hashtags. The first indicates the bullet point's topic, eg #cpan6 if it's about a Perl 6 module, the module installer, and related topics. The last indicates what happened eg #commits if someone committed something, #dialog if a dialog ensued.
* Individual items were suggested by raiph. The overall report was written by raiph.
