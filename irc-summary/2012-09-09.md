* [01:06 - 01:18](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5951965) MikeFair: "I have a rule stat_or_block { <block> | <statement> } ... the <statement> part of the rule never seems to get tested; any ideas?". TimToady "I only know how Perl 6 works (or is supposed to (or I'm supposed to))".
* [02:01 - 02:21](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952017) jeffreykegler: "I have a question about semantics in grammar rules; S05 says you set the AST element via make; But looking at STD.pm, it seems to be almost never used". TimToady: "\[[STD's](https://github.com/perl6/std/] action routines are written in Perl 5 (in viv), so it just emulates make, without using that feature of Perl 6 directly ... STD is in kind of a funny place, because it's trying not to commit to any particlar AST representation ... STD uses an Action package that dispatches to the same name as the rule that is being reduced ... which actually doesn't scale terribly well to derived grammars ... the spec intends 'make' to be useful from within the rules".
* [02:22 - 02:32](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02) MikeFair: "TimToady: I'm working on building up to establishing the AST as a service and using zmq's zero-copy mechanisms as a sort of in process SOA". TimToady: "mostly I just try to get this stuff close enough that smarter people can take it in various directions :)".
* [04:38 - 05:19](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952159) MikeFair: "TimToady: Still about? If I'm understanding the [emic and etic descriptions](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952103) right then emic => class and etic=> interface that class implements".
* [05:34 - 06:05](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952215) isBEKaml: "OHHAI, pugs-compat cabal build with GHC 7.4.1 shows failure ... I think the way to fix this would be to migrate code using IO module to using System.IO module."
* [06:15 - 06:18](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-09-02#i_5952246) sorear: "niecza is losing -Ofun for me, so I'm probably not going to be doing too much with it; my Perl 6 involvement in the future is likely to be with the Rakudo/NQP porting efforts ... niecza is really feeling the pain of some design decisions I made in early 2011". isBEKaml: "I think changing direction towards Rakudo/NQP to CLR environment won't hurt anything.". Moritz: "fwiw rakudo has had several such pain points too which lead to some of the famous rewrites".

<a name="Notes"></a>Notes

* This report covers a week of discussion and activity on [freenode IRC channel #perl6](http://webchat.freenode.net), the center of the Perl 6 community.
* The first commit of the week for each repo is usually included in this summary no matter how minor. Later commits to the same repo, especially ones by the same person, will typically be omitted even if major unless we really feel the need to bring it to attention. So <font color="maroon">**there's a heck of a lot more committing going on than appears in this summary**</font> and commits happening later in the week will often be a lot more important than the ones mentioned in this report. You can Watch the github repos that interest you if you need more info on commits.
* Each bullet point ends with two or more hashtags. The first indicates the bullet point's topic, eg #cpan6 if it's about a Perl 6 module, the module installer, and related topics. The last indicates what happened eg #commits if someone committed something, #dialog if a dialog ensued.
* Individual items were suggested by raiph. The overall report was written by raiph.
